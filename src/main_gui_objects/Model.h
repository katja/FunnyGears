/** Model (tree) of the ModelTreeView and the whole scene
 *  Responsible for adding, organising and removing items
 *
 *  Holds a tree of all GraphicsScheduleItems – the root of the tree is an GraphicsRootItem
 *  and is created in the initializer.
 *  This root item is added to the QGraphicsScene scene, too, so all other items of the
 *  model are added as children of this root item. It is not visible, as it has no graphic
 *  representation.
 *  As all GraphicsScheduleItems (the root item included) are installed on the scene,
 *  the scene is responsible for the deletion of these items.)
 *
 *  To be able to use the ModelTreeView in the ObjectScheduleViewWidget it uses Qt's
 *  QAbstractItemModel. Therefore it has implementations of the methods index(), parent(),
 *  hasChildren(), rowCount(), columnCount(), data(), setData(), headerData() and flags().
 *
 *  Qt uses objects of QModelIndex to represent the data in a QAbstractItemModel. The Model
 *  used here has a fixed number of columns (described in enum DATA). The number of rows
 *  complies with the number of children of the root item and may grow and shrink. In every
 *  cell of one row is saved the same internal pointer – the pointer to the corresponding
 *  GraphicsScheduleItem. It only differs when data() is called. Depending on the column
 *  data() calls the name() or the isVisible() on the GraphicsScheduleItem. It is no good
 *  design to have these same pointers saved several times in each row. But this approach
 *  makes the connection to the tree view easier.
 *
 *  Items can only be added as top level items! But the GraphicsScheduleItems can have
 *  children on their own (by calling setParentItem(...) on the children). Access to the
 *  child items it available by the model, too. Thus the top level items are responsible
 *  for the creation and the deletion of their child items!!!
 *
 *  When items are deleted it is very essential to inform other components of the removal.
 *  Qt provides and demandes therefore the beginRemoveRows() and the endRemoveRows() methods.
 *  As Model provides methods to remove many items at once but internal handles this by
 *  removing item by item, two new signals are introduced by class Model.
 *  QAbstractItemModel::beginRemoveRows(const QModelIndex &parent, int first, int last)
 *  emits the signal QAbstractItemModel::rowsAboutToBeRemoved(const QModelIndex &parent, int first, int last)
 *  Inspired by this the signal rowsAboutToBeRemoved() is emitted before any item is removed
 *  (and also before the beginRemoveRows(...) is called, therefore even before the first
 *  QAbstractItemModel::rowsAboutToBeRemoved(...) signal is emitted)
 *  And after all the removal has finished (and also the last endRemoveRows() had been called)
 *  signal rowsFinishedRemoval() is emitted.
