Do not forget the following things/experiments/experiences...

... qgraphicsitem_cast<T>(item) only works with T having a 'type()' method and only casts, if type() returns the same value. So a cast will not take place, if T1 inherits from T, even if both have a type() method, as they probably won't return the same value!

... the type() method of GraphicsItem and all subclasses return the static int Type. If a subclass only specifies the static int Type, but no type() method itself, Type of the parent class will be used in the parent class type() method, as Type is static!

... the QGraphicsItem class has some interesting methods: grabMouse(), ungrabMouse(), (QGraphicsScene::mouseGrabberItem(),) grabKeyboard(), ungrabKeyboard(), isPanel(), focuxProxy(), filtersChildEvents(), ...
