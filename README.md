===========

Funny Gears lets you play with spur gears in 2D and explore the basic requirement of gearing. You can form and construct your own gears and explore what a mating gear would look like. As the Gears are described by spline curves with a B-Spline basis, the program may also be intereseting for someone who wants to explore the B-Spline representation.

Features
-----------
* Create and manipulate **spline curves**
* Create your **own tooth of a gear** and construct a gear of it
* The program can construct a mating gear to your given one on basis of the **basic requirement of a gear tooth system**
* The used construction can be visualized and different colores make it easy to understand the relationship
* Set the gears in action and let them **rotate** to analyse the contact region
* Find out how the two gears interact:
    - **detect problematic points** (which do not fulfill the basic requirement of a gear tooth system)
    - analyse the **path of contact**
    - understand the **contact ratio** by the visualized coverage of the contact
* Try to improve the gearing by
    - **changing the form of a tooth** of your driving gear
    - **changing the number of teeth** of your driving gear
    - changing the number of teeth of the driven gear
* and investigate how the mating gear reacts on these changes
